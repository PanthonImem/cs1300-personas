    <h1 class = text> The UI/UX of Steam Iron </h1> 
    <i class = text> This webpage is an assignment for my class CSCI1300: UI/UX at Brown University. </i>
    </div>
    <div class = paragraph>
      <text class = text>
        In UI/UX, personas and story boards are popular choices for tool to understand the user experience of an interface. In this assignment, a student will choose an interface, observe the interaction between 3 users and the interface, then construct 2 personas and a storyboard for one of the personas. 
      </text>

      <text class = text>
        Few things in my room is as unique as the steam iron. It’s something every house has, yet I, for one, am not confident about being able to operate it proficiently despite having a solid expectation on how it works. 
      </text>
      <text class = text>
        Thus, for this assignment, I examined the interaction between different people in my household and the good old steam iron sitting in my room and generated 2 personas for users of the steam iron and a story board for one of them.

      <h2 class = text> Background: What is a Steam Iron? </h2>
      <text class = text>
        For those of you who are not familiar with steam irons, a steam iron is a tool for removing wrinkles from clothes using steam and heat. You can think of it as the predecessor of the dryer machine you have at home. 
      </text>

      <text class = text>
        Generally, for any steam iron, the four steps to successfully operate it include 
        <ol>
          <li> Fill in the water</li>
          <li> Turn the boiler on. Wait until the water boils</li>
          <li> Select the heat option depending on the kind of clothes you want to iron</li>
          <li> Press a button to release the steam as you iron your shirt</li>
        </ol>
      </text>

        Below is the steam iron we will be examining today.
      </text>

      <text class = text>
        The goal of the steam iron is to turn water into steam so users can apply both heat and steam to clothes at the same time.

        <img src="images/intf1.png" width= "500" height= "400">
        <text class = text>
          One would need to press it down while turning it to remove the lid. This is because hot steam can be very dangerous.
        </text>
      </div>

        <div class = subparagraph>
          <b class = text-nospace> Youngster Olivia</b>
          <div class = subparagraph>
            <b class = text-nospace> Description: </b>
            <text class = text>
              Youngster Olivia grew up in a home where her mother took care of laundry. When she moved out to live alone, she hired a laundry service to take care of her laundry. However, she still needs to iron her own clothes from time-to-time when she needs a specific shirt of hers to be wrinkle-free. She knows how a steam iron is supposed to work, but nevertheless she has her finger-crossed that she doesn’t accidentally ruin her favorite shirt. 
             </text>
             <b class = text-nospace> Problem: </b>
            <text class = text>
              Her knowledge about ironing is mostly theoretical, so she spent a lot of time looking at the interface and trying to figure out which button she should press.
             </text>
             <b class = text-nospace> Representation </b>
            <text class = text>
              This persona represents user#1 and user#3 who don’t usually iron that many clothes although they do possess some knowledge of how a steam iron works.

          <div class = subparagraph>
            <b class = text-nospace> Description: </b>
            <text class = text>
              For 40 years, Veteran-housewife Bertha has been doing all the chores in her house, including laundry. Her battle with an evergrowing pile of dirty laundry never ends, and so she invested in a large sturdy iron that will handle any amount of clothes, and she sticked to her tried-and-true iron. Secretly she hopes that her children will see the importance of being proficient at housework or at least have a working knowledge of how to iron a shirt for when they live on their own. 
             </text>
             <b class = text-nospace> Problem: </b>
            <text class = text>
              Even her finds it difficult to learn the different steps to using an iron model, so she sticks to one she’s familiar with and hope that it lasts her long enough that she never have to buy a new one. 
             </text>
             <b class = text-nospace> Representation </b>
            <text class = text>
              This persona represents user#2 who has ironed many, many clothes in her entire life and is very familiar with steam irons.

          <h3> Storyboard</h3>

        <h3> Conclusion</h3>
        <text class = text>
          This investigation about a steam iron reveals a tradeoff in design for most specialized tool.<br>
          There is a tradeoff between intuitiveness of interface and the complexity of operation<br>
        </text>
        <text class = text>
          For this steam iron, we might assume that it is more catered towards 'serious users' like professional laundry services 
          or housewives who use them frequently.<br>
        </text>
        <text class = text>
          Nevertheless, there still exists many improvement which could be done to the interface such as 
          making the water tank lid more intuitive to use, or putting an instruction sticker on the product.
